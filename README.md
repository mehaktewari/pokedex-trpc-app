# Pokedex Full Stack App

This is a full stack Pokedex application built using:

- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Prisma ORM
- tRPC
- Material UI

## Features

1. Search Pokemon by name
2. Fetch multiple Pokemon
3. Filter Pokemon by type

## Approach

I used Prisma to model the Pokemon schema and seeded mock data.
tRPC was used to create type-safe backend routes.
Material UI was used for building a clean and responsive UI.

## Improvements Added

- Case insensitive search
- Loading and error states
- Proper DB schema using array types
